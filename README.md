<h1>What is Three js?<h1>
<hr>
Three.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers. It simplifies the process of working with WebGL, the low-level graphics API built into modern browsers, making it easier to create 3D content without having to write complex WebGL code directly. <br>


<h1>What is the scene in three js? <h1>
<hr>
In Three.js, a scene is a container that holds all the objects, lights, and cameras that make up the 3D world. It acts as a canvas where you define the various elements of your 3D scene, and it organizes how objects interact with each other. <br>


<h1>Dimension<h1>
<hr>
We humans only understand 5 dimensions. <br>
=> Zeroth Dimensions(OD)( Just a Point) <br>
=> Frist Dimensions(1D) ( A Line ) <br>
=> Second Dimension(2D) (It is a Shape with length and width but no depth)( Like Paper) <br>
=> Third Dimension(3D) (Space with  length and width and depth) (like human) <br>
=> Forth Dimension (4D) (Time) <br>

<h1>3D programming with JavaScript</h1>
In 3D programming with JavaScript, particularly in libraries like Three.js, positions are typically represented using three axes: X, Y, and Z. These coordinates define where an object is located in 3D space. Letâ€™s break down each axis and how positioning works in 3D.

1. X-Axis (Horizontal Position) <br>
=> Represents the horizontal position of an object.<br>
=> A positive X value moves the object to the right.<br>
=> A negative X value moves the object to the left.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Y-Axis (Vertical Position)<br>
=> Represents the vertical position of an object.<br>
=> A positive Y value moves the object up.<br>
=> A negative Y value moves the object down.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Z-Axis (Depth Position) <br>
=> Represents the depth of an object in 3D space. <br>
=> A positive Z value moves the object toward the camera (closer to the viewer). <br>
=> A negative Z value moves the object away from the camera (farther from the viewer) <br>

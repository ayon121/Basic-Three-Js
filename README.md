What is Three js?
Three.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers. It simplifies the process of working with WebGL, the low-level graphics API built into modern browsers, making it easier to create 3D content without having to write complex WebGL code directly.
#What is the scene in three js? 
In Three.js, a scene is a container that holds all the objects, lights, and cameras that make up the 3D world. It acts as a canvas where you define the various elements of your 3D scene, and it organizes how objects interact with each other.
